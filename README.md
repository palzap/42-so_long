# so_long

## Overview
So_Long is a project that involves creating a 2D game using the Minilibx (a simple graphics library) in C. The goal is to create a game where the player (represented by a character sprite) navigates through a maze-like map and collects collectibles (coins, for example) while avoiding obstacles (such as walls or enemies). The game ends when the player reaches the exit of the map.

The project requires the creation of a parser that reads a file containing the map layout and uses it to generate the game environment. The player movement and collision detection should also be implemented. In addition, the project requires error handling and proper memory management to prevent leaks.

The focus of the project is on the graphics and game mechanics, but it also tests the student's ability to use C programming concepts, such as file I/O, structs, and pointers, to create a functional game.
